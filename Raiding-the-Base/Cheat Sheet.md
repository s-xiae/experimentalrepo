# Cheat Sheet
*DO NOT READ IF YOU'VE GOTTEN ALL ENDINGS IN THIS GAME AND KNOW ALL FAILS IN THE GAME. THIS IS ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE STUCK ON SOME PART AND NEED TO SEARCH SOME PART OF THE GAME.*

### You are in a top secret military division.
You get assigned a task from general, to infiltrate the hyper clan, which is trying to take over the world.
You are really close to their base, and have 6 options:
1. Bomb [x]: You throw a bomb, but then when it explodes, base is unharmed, and there are now some angry hyper clan members shooting at the Helicopter. (Use imploding bombs, one exploding ones.)
2. Drill [x]: As soon as you attempt to drill into the base, the drill brakes, since the walls are extremely strong. (Okay, now this already is getting ridiculous, and this just started.)
3. Teleporter: You teleport into the building. See Disasterous Dark Day for the Hyper Clan Ending.
4. Sneak in: You manage to bypass the guards in the front. See Sudden Arrest Ending.
5. Cheese: The cheese somehow gets you past the guards. See Busted! Ending.
6. Bean [x]: You eat it and nothing happens. (I'll tell you that absolutely nothing happens if eat it.)


### Disasterous Dark Day for the Hyper Clan
You see 2 guards, and they notice you.
1. Bean [x]: You eat it. Nothing happens. (I told you!)
2. Sniper Rifle [x]: You attempt to use your sniper rifle, but you notice that you forgot to reload the mag. (Hey! Being prepared doesn't hurt at all!)
3. Disappear [x]: You eat a pill of disappearing powder, but the guards use invisibility goggles to find you. (Huh, that isn't possible.)
4. Pistol: You manage to load your pistol and shoot both guards down.

You go past the guards just to find a glass wall and nothing else.
1. Bean [x]: You eat it. You grow extremely big, but that just causes difficulties. (Bruh.)
2. Hammer [x]: You hammer the wall. Another guard notices you and you get caught. (Oh noes ther goes el bozo ratio.)
3. Hammer [x]: You hit your head. (Woah, woah, woah... Careful there!)
4. Hammer: A guard notices you. He shoots at you, but then you manage to deflect the bullet onto the glass. The glass shatters.

You find the core of the base. All of the files are contained in there, and if you remove it, the Hyper clan will have an extremely dark day.
1. Bean [x]: Bruh. (YOU AREN'T ALLOWED TO GET ANYMORE ENDINGS EVER AGAIN. STAHP CHOOSING THE BEAN.)
2. Remove Core [x]: You attempt to remove the core. The core is so heavy that you get smashed by it. (This is what I tried to warn you about!)
3. Hammer [x]: The core breaks, and the base explodes, along with you. (I never knew that.)
4. Zero-Point Energy: You use a zero-point energy glove to guide the core back to the helicopter.

Eventually, the base goes havoc because with no core, the base is a disaster.


### Sudden Arrest
You go towards the clan's file room. 5 guards notice you.
1. Timeout [x]: You get shot like 30 times. (Oh wow, that is just sad)
2. Sniper Rifle [x]: You attempt to use your sniper rifle, but you notice that you forgot to reload the mag. (I told you once, GET PREPARED.)
3. Teddy bear [x]: You pull out a teddy bear, but you don't realize that it's a bomb. (Guys, look! A b̵̮͎̜̬͍̱̙̺̟̝̲̝̰͔͎͍̍̃̎̀̉̓i̷̬͙̟͉̖͐̀͗̚ṛ̵͇͚͓̻̤̥̪̇͊̿̓̄̍͊͒̂͆̄͘d̷̡͕̙̱̤̳̘͚͓̘̟̾͛̓͌͋ͅì̷̭͍̙̞̬̈͒̓̎́̊͂̔͒͆̃̓̕̕e̵̩̜͈͉͔͕̣͉̝̪̩̗͈̎͒͛̾͋̇̍̈̚ bomb!)
4. Dodge: You dodge all of the guards bullets, catch 5 of them, and throw them at the guard's guns. They get scared and they leave you alone.

You end up in a vault room. You look around, and the suddenly found some files that are lying there.
1. Rush things [x]: You try to get the files as fast as you can, but you trip and the alarm goes off. (Take your time now.)
2. Take time [x]: You take your time, but 2 guards bust you out. (Maybe don't take too much time now.)
3. Grab files: You grab the files.

You need to find a way to get out of there.
1. Sneak out [x]: You try getting out of there, but you get caught by the clan leader himself. (Great job. You turned yourself in.)
2. Cheese [x]: You eat the cheese, but then you become ginormous and you can't move. (At least it isn't a bomb.)
3. Teleporter: You escape the base via teleporter and give the proof to your general.

The next day, your government division stages a raid in the base and arrests every single one of the clan members.


### Busted!
You fight some guards that see you bust in.
1. Attack [x]: You attack, but the guards easily overpower you. (You should bring some other people with you.)
2. Multi power [x]: You use a combo move, but it doesn't work. (Gotta master those, no matter what.)
3. RPG: You start attacking RPG-style, and after you beat every single one of those guards, you bust into the hallway.

You run towards the clan leader's office. He sees you and starts running away. You chase him. He calls someone to close some doors.
1. Timeout [x]: You slam into one of the walls. (Watch where you're going!)
2. Warp [x]: You warp in front of him, but all of that energy caused paralysis. (That type of technology is for superhumans, not you.)
3. Burp: You start running backwards and then you burp and bump into the clan leader.

The leader continues running and he summons his second in command.
1. RPG [x]: You attempt to attack RPG-style again, but his second in command defies all of the RPG game rules. (All your base are belong to us)
2. OWRPG [x]: You attempt to attack Open World RPG-style, but these types of RPGs don't have attack functions at all. (I still wonder...)
3. ARPG: You attack Action RPG-style, and beat his second in command.

You seize the leader, and force towards the enterance.
1. Jet pack [x]: You grab the leader and use a jet pack to go towards the helicopter. The jet pack malfunctions and you end up everywhere. (Error 404: Cannot process 'run' command)
2. Gun [x]: You shoot the leader. The guards see it and kills you. (Don't do it in front of guards, bro.)
3. Teleporter: You teleport into the helicopter.

You then force the leader to spit everything he has to say about the clan out, and the clan gets busted.
