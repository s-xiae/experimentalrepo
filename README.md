# experimentalrepo description

## What this repo is:
This repo is just a first time experiment before I start creating a bunch of stuff. This has a bunch of experimental stuff, so deal with it.
## Why this repo exists:
This repo is not the first repo that I've created, as for this repo is created on a school account, but that one has nothing in it. I'm just playing around with this repo before I start actually doing stuff on GitHub (It takes a while for me to get used to GitHub as soon as you transition from Replit to GitHub, though I still use GitHub).
## What this repo does:
This repo is just me playing around on GitHub, there maybe a super small game on here that I created on Replit, but other than that, there's nothing on here.
## Thanks for reading this
Yeah I know this is useless, but still read this, there's a game I coded like a year ago that'll be in this repo. Good luck playing.
